C# Code Louisville Capstone Project: __WhereIsMy__ Useful Console App

The purpose of this console application is to log a location and time for your everyday items: car keys, laptop, cell phone, etc. in the event that if you are like me, and cannot remember where you put them last and have to repeatedly annoy your wife with 'Where is my...' questions. :) Which is where the idea for this application was originated. It includes some fun banter with selections and resposnes, don't be alarmed, all meant to be light hearted fun. Here's to helping you clear out some brain space honey! (Love you!)

The user is able to view their items within the console utilizing numbered selections in a table-like structure.  They can add as many items as they would like to track.  Once they've identified the ID of the item they're looking for, the user can then remove that item and add it to a new location with a new ID (not efficient or effective long-term, future-state will include an UPDATE method allowing the user to select a single item and edit the name or location based on it's ID).

There is no special instructions to running this application other than opening the solution file and hitting run.  The json file and directory will be created in the event it does not exist.
